# LeetCode-Sol-Res
This repository contains my solutions and resources on [LeetCode Online Judge](https://oj.leetcode.com) algorithm problems. Most of my solutions are derived from my own implementation, the problem discussion section and [ninechapter.com](http://www.ninechapter.com). These solutions are also cleaned and optimized according to my preference, which makes them more readable and understandable.

There are also some other problems that worth taking a look. I put them in Other for reference. 
  
## Features  

### Understandable Solutions  

1. All free problems are divided into 3 files according to its relative level: easy, middle and hard.  
2. All solutions have problem description and tags at the top.   
3. All solutions have solution explanation before function.   
4. All solutions have in line comment on certain key points.
5. Some solutions have several different solutions to compare, the first solution is my recommendation.     
  
### Solutions Table for Quick Review

I build a table for all solutions, which has the frequency of problems. Frequency is derived from online resources and my own interview experience. It would be of great help if you are on the way to an interview. You can do a very quick review with the help of it.

# LeetCode-Sol-Res
  
This repository contains my solutions and resources on [LeetCode Online Judge](https://oj.leetcode.com) algorithm problems. Most of the solutions are derived from my own implementation, the problem discussion section and [ninechapter.com](http://www.ninechapter.com). 

All solutions are carefully cleaned and optimized, thus more readable and understandable!  
  
Some resources related to LeetCode are in "Resources". More resources will be added.  
  
Some other problems that worth taking a look are put in "Other" for reference.
